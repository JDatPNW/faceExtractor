# faceTrack
A framework which allows to collect data (faces) for machine- and  deep-learning algorithms, from:
* YouTube videos
* Images (all in 1 folder)
* Video files (saved locally)

This was meant to help with class projects that require big data-sets, which can sometimes be hard and tedious to come by.
